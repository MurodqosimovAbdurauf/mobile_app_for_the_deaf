# Project Name

## Description
This mobile application is very useful for deaf people to communicate with others and to shape and develop their speech. The speech visual part displays the letters spoken by a person in real time in a visual form.
There is also a haptic device that connects to a mobile app. The device converts the sound messages received from the mobile app into vibration signals and transmits them to the human body. This helps deaf people understand sound through skin sensation.
uzb:
Ushbu mobil ilova karlar uchun boshqalar bilan muloqot qilish va nutqini shakllantirish va rivojlantirish uchun juda foydali. Nutqning vizual qismi real vaqtda shaxs tomonidan aytilgan harflarni vizual shaklda aks ettiradi.
Mobil ilovaga ulanadigan haptik qurilma ham mavjud. Qurilma mobil ilovadan olingan ovozli xabarlarni tebranish signallariga aylantiradi va ularni inson tanasiga uzatadi. Bu karlarga teri hissi orqali tovushni tushunishga yordam beradi.
